# WHAT THIS SCRIPT ENFORCES, stated because a developer running it should be able to read
# what it refuses and why. Every check below ends in a message on stderr and a non-zero
# exit status - never a warning, never a fallback - and nothing is generated when one
# fails. Seven controls, each closing a way this build could otherwise be turned into
# arbitrary code execution or a disclosure:
#
#   1. INPUT. PROJECT_VERSION comes from `git describe --tags`, which is repository data
#      rather than a trusted constant. make expands a command-line variable RECURSIVELY
#      and exports it into every recipe's shell, so a tag named `v$(SSH_PRIVATE_KEY)` or
#      `v$(shell touch /tmp/x)` is expanded or executed by make rather than printed, and
#      shell quoting does not prevent it because make re-expands the value after the shell
#      has finished with it. `git check-ref-format` accepts both of those tag names, so
#      they are valid input rather than malformed input. The version and the site title are
#      therefore accepted only from the character set a version and a title need, bounded
#      in length, refused when they begin with '-', and passed to make quoted.
#   2. PROVENANCE. The generator checkout must come from the official repository, decided
#      by remote HOST AND PATH rather than by equality with one spelling of the URL: a
#      substring or suffix comparison also accepts
#      https://evil.example.com/rdkcentral/hal-doxygen, which is a different project, while
#      a single-string comparison rejects the equivalent https:// and ssh:// spellings of
#      the real one. A local filesystem origin is refused, because a path authenticates
#      nothing about the content behind it.
#   3. IDENTITY. The pin names a tag, and a tag is a movable label, so resolving the name
#      proves nothing on its own: a checkout carrying a tag of the same name over other
#      content resolves it happily. The commit that tag must resolve to is recorded beside
#      the pin and asserted, and the checkout is then required to be DETACHED at exactly
#      that commit, so no branch tip can move underneath a later run.
#   4. INTEGRITY. `git checkout` keeps non-conflicting local modifications and untracked
#      additions, so a tampered Makefile, Doxyfile.cfg or header.html executes while HEAD
#      still reports the expected commit. The checkout must therefore be clean with
#      untracked files included; its git directory must be the ordinary directory inside
#      it, not a gitdir redirect pointing somewhere unverified; it must carry no local
#      configuration key or hook that lets git run a program of the checkout's choosing;
#      and no index entry may be marked assume-unchanged or skip-worktree, which would make
#      a modified tracked file report clean.
#   5. CONTAINMENT. ./build and ./output must both be real directories inside this docs/
#      directory. The generator's Doxyfile.cfg sets OUTPUT_DIRECTORY to ../output resolved
#      from ./build, so Doxygen writes the entire generated site through ./output, and a
#      symlink there - at its root or at any depth beneath it - redirects every one of
#      those writes out of the repository.
#   6. TIME OF CHECK VERSUS TIME OF USE. Containment, revision and cleanliness are
#      asserted again immediately before make, with nothing between them and the build, so
#      a concurrent writer cannot substitute a different tree between verification and use.
#   7. DIAGNOSTICS. Every URL this script prints passes through redact_url, so a remote
#      configured with credentials in its userinfo - https://user:token@host/path - is
#      reported by host and path and the credential does not reach a terminal or a build
#      log. For the same reason no refusal echoes the version string it rejected: that
#      string is attacker-chosen data, and a log is a place other tools read.
#
# Nothing is fetched, and nothing outside ./output is written, when ./build is already the
# pinned generator: an established checkout builds with no network access at all.
